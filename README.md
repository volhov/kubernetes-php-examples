# Kubernetes PHP Examples

Some basic Kubernetes + PHP/Laravel examples for a talk I did titled: [Adventures with Kubernetes and Laravel at Superbalist](https://www.meetup.com/Cape-Town-PHP-Group/events/237226310/) at the [Cape Town PHP Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Cape-Town-PHP-Group/events/237226310/)

They use my [zoidbergwill/php](https://github.com/zoidbergwill/docker-php) Docker image that installs php7-fpm and composer on Alpine 3.5.
